# Tennis League Script
 Python Script to automate joining local tennis league every week.

Made using Python, Selenium, and Chrome Driver. 
This can be customized by inputing your Username and Password in to the variables as well as the path to the chrome driver. This script should also work on Firefox but will not work on Safari because clicking is not natively supported.
